            <h3>Green Tea</h3>
            Green tea, looking at the fermentation chart above, has 0% fermentation, so it is in its pure form. It is also known to be a very healthy tea to drink and has become the most categorized tea from our experience and research.

            <h3>Oolong Tea</h3>
            After green tea, we have Oolong as the next most popular category of Chinese tea.Also, when looking at the fermentation chart, this style tea sits in the middle with a 30 – 60% range.
